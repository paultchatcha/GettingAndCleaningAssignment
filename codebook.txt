[1] "subjects"                   
[2] "activity"                   

These variables are names as follows

[Avg][t/f][Body/Gravity][Acc/Gyro][Jerk/Mag][mean/std][X/Y/Z]

Avg as "Average"
t/f as "Time or Frequency"
Body/Gravity as "Body or Gravity"
Acc/Gyro as "Accelerometer or Gyroscope"
mean/std as "mean or standard deviation"
Jerk/Mag as "Jerk or magnitude signals"
X/Y/Z representing axis

This gives the average for each subject for each activity the time/frequence for body/gravity 
from accelerometer or gyroscope of mean/standard deviation mesurements collected on axis X/Y/Z
Some may be derived from Jerk or Magnitude or both signals.
