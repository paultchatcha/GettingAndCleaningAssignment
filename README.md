Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope
Based on the first analysis report available here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
We perform a deaper analysis summarizing averages for each activity and each subject on measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
The code book for the resulting dataset can be found in codebook.txt
